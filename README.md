Hugo


## Post Example
To create a simple post use the hugo new command as usual.
This theme makes use of page bundles / page resource (see https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).
Place any image next to your post's index.md file and make sure it contains the keyword "cover" inside its name.
This image will also be used for twitter and opengraph cards.

```
hugo new blog/my-first-post/index.md
```
